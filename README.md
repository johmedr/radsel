# RADSEL: Radius selection for nonlinear measures.

The RADSEL function automates the selection of an optimal radius parameter for estimating nonlinear measures from finite-length temporal signals. It leverages the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) framework to improve the precision of measures such as the correlation dimension and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. This function is particularly useful for analyzing signals generated by nonlinear systems and experimental electroencephalographic time series.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your machine to use RADSEL. The function is compatible with MATLAB R2018a and later versions.

### Installation

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file to get started with RADSEL:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RADSEL.git
```

Navigate to the RADSEL directory in MATLAB to access the function.

## Usage

To use RADSEL, load your data into MATLAB and call the function with your data matrix as the input. The function syntax is as follows:

```matlab
radius = RADSEL(X, P, D, N, STD, IQR)
```

- `X`: Input data matrix (samples x dimensions).
- `P` (optional): Norm order (default is 2, Euclidean distance).
- `D` (optional): Number of dimensions to consider (default is all columns in `X`).
- `N` (optional): Number of samples to consider (default is all rows in `X`).
- `STD` (optional): Standard deviation of the input data (default is calculated from `X`).
- `IQR` (optional): Interquartile range of the input data (default is calculated from `X`).

### Examples

Load your data and call RADSEL:

```matlab
load('yourData.mat'); % Replace 'yourData.mat' with your data file
optimalRadius = RADSEL(data);
disp(['Optimal Radius: ', num2str(optimalRadius)]);
```
